‚ÑπÔ∏è Created in 2016 by [Pierre Raybaut](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut) and maintained by the [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) organization.

‚ÑπÔ∏è PlotPy ***V2*** is the new major release of [`guiqwt`](https://github.com/PierreRaybaut/guiqwt): same team üèãÔ∏è, same goal üéØ, same long-term support ‚è≥.

## Overview

`plotpy` is is a Python library providing efficient 2D data-plotting features
for interactive computing and signal/image processing application development.
It is part of the [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) project, aiming at
providing a unified framework for creating scientific GUIs with Python and Qt.

`plotpy` is based on:

* [Python](http://www.python.org) language and [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/) GUI toolkit (via [PySide](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/) or [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro))
* [guidata](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/guidata) automatic GUI generation library
* [PythonQwt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonQwt) plotting widgets library
* [NumPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/NumPy) and [SciPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SciPy) scientific computing libraries

See [documentation](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details on
the library and [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for recent history of changes.

## Features

The `plotpy` library also provides the following features.

General plotting features:

* Ready-to-use [plot widgets and dialog boxes](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/plot/index.html)
* [pyplot](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/pyplot.html): interactive
  plotting widgets, equivalent to `matplotlib.pyplot`, at least for the implemented functions
* Supported [plot items](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/items/index.html):
  curves, images, contours, histograms, labels, shapes, annotations, ...

Interactive features (i.e. not only programmatic plotting but also with mouse/keyboard):

* Multiple object selection for moving objects or editing their properties through
  automatically generated dialog boxes
* Item list panel: move objects from foreground to background, show/hide objects,
  remove objects, ...
* Customizable aspect ratio for images
* Tons of ready-to-use tools: plot canvas export to image file, image snapshot,
  interval selection, image rectangular filter, etc.
* Curve fitting tool with automatic fit, manual fit with sliders, ...
* Contrast adjustment panel for images: select the LUT by moving a range selection
  object on the image levels histogram, eliminate outliers, ...
* X-axis and Y-axis cross-sections: support for multiple images, average
  cross-section tool on a rectangular area, ...
* Apply any affine transform to displayed images in real-time (rotation,
  magnification, translation, horizontal/vertical flip, ...)

Application development helpers:

* Ready-to-use [plot widgets and dialog boxes](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/plot/index.html)
* Load/save graphical objects (curves, images, shapes) into HDF5, JSON or INI files
* A lot of test scripts which demonstrate `plotpy` features
  (see [examples](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/examples.html))

## Dependencies and installation

See [Installation](https://plotpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/installation.html)
section in the documentation for more details.
